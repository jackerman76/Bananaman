*Brainstoriming Page for backend stuff*

3 pieces of info to store: users, posts, requests
  * Object for each
  * Store contents of object in 3 separate databases
  * create object mapper to map from json to object?

User
  - unique ID
  - username
  - password
  - email
  - phone number
  - activity ? Should we keep track of the users activity?
      Write to logs? Not necessary. keep track of things that
      are going to change state. EX: introduce likes

Post
  - Timestamp
  - How Many
  - Geolocation
  - Picture (path I assume) - where do the pictures go tho?
  - User Posted
  - Status
  - description

Request
  - Radius
  - Quantity
  - Timestamp
  - User
  - Description

Where do we store the posts?
How do we relate the posts to the users?
Where should we store images?
Is it ok to just get location from users ip address?
  Do we need to ask for permission?
Bootstrap?

Flask sessions and cookies?

No get methods

Create mechanism to store objects
user_to_entity(user):
puts user into entity

Push image feature off until last section of class

Javascript has method to allow to access exact
location. Only way is through browser. IP address
is not accurate.

store user key instead of user id
